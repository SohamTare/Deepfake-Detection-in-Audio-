Deepfake Audio Detection is a machine learning project that detects manipulated audio using advanced signal processing and AI techniques.
**# Deepfake Audio Detection 🎤🤖**

This repository contains the code for detecting deepfake audio using machine learning techniques. The code includes preprocessing, model training, and detection scripts. It is designed to be used with any dataset of your choice, and the model has achieved up to **80% accuracy** when tested with my own dataset.

**## ⚙️ Code Description**

This repository includes the following:

- **Preprocessing scripts**: For extracting features from audio files.
- **Model training**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify audio as real or manipulated.
- **Detection scripts**: For predicting whether an audio sample is real or fake.
- **Helper functions**: For evaluation and performance analysis.

Note: This repository contains **only the code**. You will need to use your own dataset for training and testing the model.

**## 🛠️ Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:  
  - `librosa` for audio processing
  - `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` (or `pytorch` depending on the implementation)
  - Other dependencies in `requirements.txt`

**## 📦 Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/SohamTare/deepfake-audio-detection.git
   cd deepfake-audio-detection

2. Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

🏃‍♂️ Usage
Preprocess your audio dataset by running the preprocessing script (modify it according to your dataset).

python preprocess_audio.py --input <input_directory>
Train the model:

python train_model.py --data <processed_data_directory>
Detect fake audio:

python detect_fake_audio.py --input <audio_file>
Example usage:

python detect_fake_audio.py --input test_audio.wav


📊 Results
When tested with my own dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of 80%.
